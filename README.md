========
YodaSlang is a translation website that creates Yoda-like translations.
Instead of relying on switching of sentence members, it uses free
online translation services by Google, Bing, MyMemory. YodaSlang relies of translating the
text sequentially from language A through the series of other languages to (*most common case*) **back** to
language A.

Since modern machine language translation faces great difficulties translation natural languages back and forth
thee result of such translations start sounding more and more like Yoda. But sentences can become pretty absurd 
from "They call me Yoda." to the final result of "I call them Yoda."



[YodaSlang](http://www.yodaslang.com) is [YodaSpeak](http://www.yodaspeak.co.uk/) not.
YodaSlang does not shift words around to make it seem as if Master Yoda was talking. 
It only uses translation services (usually machine translation). 
If you are looking for shifting words around, however, the YodaSpeak is a tool that might be of help to you. 
And may the force be with you.
